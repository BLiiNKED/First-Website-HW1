    <h2><u>Drums vs. Guitar</u></h2>
    <p>People often ask if it's harder to learn drums or guitar. Drums tend to be harder for most because you'll need to master a three-way coordination just to get started.
    With guitars, you can learn basic chords quickly and usually get a nice sound without any knowledge which makes it less reliant on rhythm.
    However, drums rely more on keeping a <b>reliable time</b>.
    Apart from keeping the rhythm of the entire band, playing drums is also more physically demanding; 
    <span style="color:red">requiring you to use <b>both arms and legs</b> to play the instrument.</p></span>

    <h2><u>Advantages of Learning Drums</u></h2>
    <p>There are many upsides to learning the drums, especially if they are your first instrument.
    It helps build a good sense of rhythm for learning other instruments. This will help you build a inner-sense of timing.
    Also, once you master one beat, you can learn a ton of others easily. It's hard to work your hands and feet seperately, but once you get past that roadblock then the rest is way easier.
    If interested, drummers are also in high demand. Being the rhythm of the band, you have no room for mistake like guitars since they're more obvious, hence the standard for drummers is higher. This means there are more gigs as a drummer than you might initially assume.

<p id="about"><h3>About:</h3></p>
<p>My name is Christian Valdez and I'm 23 years old.
    I graduated from STC with a Culinary Arts degree 5 years ago and now I'm coming back to study Computer
    Science at UTRGV. Once I get a new job, I want to pay for drum classes at Guitar Center since they aren't cheap.
    I have a passion for all things music and electronic so finding out what I want to do as a career is tough sometimes.
    All I know is that both of these topics will stay with me for the rest of my life.
